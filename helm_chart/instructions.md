In this example, the Chart.yaml file provides basic metadata for the chart, while the values.yaml file defines configuration values that can be customized during deployment. The deployment.yaml file describes the Deployment resource, specifying the number of replicas and container image details. The service.yaml file defines the Service resource for exposing the application internally within the cluster.

To use this Helm chart, you would package these files into a directory and use Helm commands such as helm install to deploy it onto a Kubernetes cluster. You can also customize the configuration values by providing a separate values file or specifying them directly on the command line.
